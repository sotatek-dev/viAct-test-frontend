# viAct-test-frontend

## Disclaimer
#### I very aware about the UI of this little project, to be honest it hurts my eyes but due to the shortage of time, I only have more than 4 hours, I'm more focusing on the structure and implementing all requirements correctly and other perfomance issues which I've listed down below. 
#### Thanks for the chance of doing this together and I hope to get some feedback from you guys even when this is not qualify. 
## What I've implement
- React with TypeScript
- Redux (using Easy Peasy)
- Material UI
- Responsive looks

## Other implementation
- Server-side pagination
- Debounce on user doing search
- Separate component and modules
